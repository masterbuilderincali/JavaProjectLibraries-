public class BubbleSort {
	/*How it work: 
	 *   repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, 
	 *   comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
	 *   The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 
	 *Efficiency:
	 *	 worst-case and average complexity both Ðž(n2),   
	 *   bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large; perform better in best-case: list already sorted
	 *Cons:
	 *   The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted. 
	 *Optimizing:
	 *   The bubble sort algorithm can be easily optimized by observing that the n-th pass finds the n-th largest element and 
	 *   puts it into its final place. So, the inner loop can avoid looking at the last n-1 items when running for the n-th time
